           Whether you’re in the mood for the art deco vibe of a lounge or the grit and glory of a classic dive bar, it might help to know the unwritten codes and customs of bartenders before you sit down to order a drink.</b>
</p>
<p class ="text-bartender"><b>
You may already realize it’s rude to ask the bartender to charge your cellphone behind the bar or that your server isn’t exactly interested in hearing your life story, but have you ever asked them which drinks they most judge people for requesting, or how many drinks can be ordered before they pull the plug?

Instead of asking that one friend who thinks they know everything about bar etiquette, we went straight to the source. To understand the real do’s and don’ts when it comes to what you should order and how you should behave at a bar, we surveyed over 260 current and former American bartenders to get their take on the biggest mistakes patrons make whendealing with their servers. Want to know which quirks bartenders consider the most annoying, how much you’re really supposed to tip (according to them), and the truth behind getting cut off? Read on to find out what we discovered.

Is this corner of a food court really where Peach State cocktail kings Greg Best, Regan Smith, and Paul Calvert have decided to set up shop? Gaze upward and the theatrical lighting through the beams may give you the impression that you’re embedded in a sitcom soundstage: The Iceman Cometh meets Cheers. After a few minutes, though, you’ll forget all that and simply feel as though you’ve come home. Is there a friendlier bar in America right now? Hard to imagine, just as it’s hard to imagine another place where excellent cocktails are presented with such unpretentious joy. What you’re drinking: The Ticonderoga Cup, a blend of aged rum, cognac, sherry, fresh lemon, and a housemade pineapple cordial. 99 Krog Street Northeast —Jeff Gordinier

The World Famous</h1>      
          <p class ="text-bartender">
  <b>                    
 


White-oak essence wafting along America’s southern cities’ sidewalks leads to both establishment and renovation. Just like tree rings, the World Famous has something to say. Lodged in the middle of “Hot Corner,” once a roaring cluster of African-American-owned businesses, the chess-piece-looking building is both gastro-dive-bar and music locale. A bar life where the first-rate fare entwines with hip-hop acts and a whiskey stash? Solid. Pro tip: Order the poutine and Creature Comforts Automatic pale ale (a tribute to local restaurateur Dexter Weaver and REM’s Automatic for the People album). 351 North Hull Street —Nicole A.

As soon as I sat at the bar, which is partially padded by yellow vinyl as if it were baby-proofed for shot-happy drunks, I was told . . . shot specials. Fernet. Sombra mezcal. Old Forester. And that’s when it’s revealed: This is not your dad’s dive of off-brand well spirits. But precious cocktail joint it is not. Go ahead and order that shot at 3:00 p.m. or enjoy a dangerously delicious frozen hurricane, one of the most popular drinks on the menu­—no one’s judging. Pro tip: The branded Nickel City hats they sell are pretty cool. 1133 East Eleventh Street —Kevin Sintumuang

Too many speakeasy-type places still reek of the Gatsby remake. The Elk Room, praise Leo, is not that bar. Grab one of the six bar seats and meet Shaun Stewart and Andrew Nichols. The duo make inspired drinks of and with nearly anything—Stewart once won a cocktail competition using Jägermeister. What you’re drinking: The Poe’s Raven, which is inspired by It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’s rum-ham episode, is a good place to start. 1010 Fleet Street —Brady Langmann

Manci's Antique Club</h1>

  <b>                    
 


During Prohibition, it was rumored, cars weren’t the only things getting lubricated at Italian immigrant Buster Manci’s filling station. By 1936, the pretense was gone, or maybe just morphed: Soon manci’s antique club was the shingle that welcomed customers to his dark-wood dive. Pack rat Manci filled every inch with junk—oh, I mean antiques—including one of the world’s largest collections of Jim Beam decorative decanters. There’s plenty to explore, but beware, female first-timers who enter the ladies’. That cutout of Adam may have lift here on the fig leaf shielding his genitals, but peeking triggers a bar-wide alarm. The offender’s walk of shame back to her barstool runs through the gantlet of applauding locals. Or so I, uh, heard from a friend. What you’re drinking: The Bloody Mary, garnished with a pickled string bean, okra, olive—and applause. 1715 Main Street —Beth Ann Fennelly

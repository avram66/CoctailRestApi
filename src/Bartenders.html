           Whether you’re in the mood for the art deco vibe of a lounge or the grit and glory of a classic dive bar, it might help to know the unwritten codes and customs of bartenders before you sit down to order a drink.</b>

<p class ="text-bartender"><b>
You may already realize it’s rude to ask the bartender to charge your cellphone behind the bar or that your server isn’t exactly interested in hearing your life story, but have you ever asked them which drinks they most judge people for requesting, or how many drinks can be ordered before they pull the plug?

Instead of asking that one friend who thinks they know everything about bar etiquette, we went straight to the source. To understand the real do’s and don’ts when it comes to what you should order and how you should behave at a bar, we surveyed over 260 current and former American bartenders to get their take on the biggest mistakes patrons make whendealing with their servers. Want to know which quirks bartenders consider the most annoying, how much you’re really supposed to tip (according to them), and the truth behind getting cut off? Read on to find out what we discovered.

              Before you’ve put in your drink order with the bartender, have you ever stopped to think what your refreshment of choice says about you? According to the men and women filling your glass, a lot can be gleaned just by your choice of cocktail.

          <p class ="text-bartender"><b>Some drinks are far more likely to carry a certain connotation than others. According to our panel of current and past bartenders, nearly half said they thought less of patrons who asked them to put together an appletini. Crafted for the first time in the late ’90s, the apple martini (or appletini for short) could be a relic of the past that needs to stay put.

             If you find yourself at the bar in a restaurant, consider staying away from these drinks if you don’t want to fall out of favor with the person behind the counter. The Jägerbomb, sex on the beach, and even light beers carried a negative connotation, according to the bartenders who spent time pouring them out. Where foodie culture in the U.S. is concerned, the cocktail “revolution” may be on its way out, but that doesn’t mean you should order the first thing that comes to mind from a mixologist at a cocktail bar. Frozen drinks (an order judged by 39 percent of bartenders) and the Irish car bomb (30 percent) were quickly scorned, particularly by cocktail bartenders we polled.

Like any profession, there are formal and informal rules when it comes to serving alcohol in the U.S. You don’t always have to be 21 years old to work as a bartender, and in some states, it’s only legal to serve alcohol at certain times of the day. Still, there are more unwritten rules you’d like to hope your bartenders abide by. Refusing to make a drink that’s too complicated is frowned upon in addition to spending too much time on the phone instead of on the clock.

The same way you might hope your bartender is on his or her best behavior when you take a seat for the night, bartenders surveyed had etiquette standards of their own to share. On our scale of pleasant to completely annoying, asking for a free drink ranked as the most aggravating thing patrons could do (especially among female bartenders). Things can get loud and busy depending on where you’re drinking, but whistling to get the bartender’s attention should be avoided as well.
